# Duck goose

Write a program that asks the user for a string, and then **prints** `Equal amount` if the substrings `duck` and `goose` appear the same number of times in the given string.
Otherwise it should **print** `Different amount`.

*Note: Python's built in function count() may be useful.*

*Hint: This question is case-sensitive, so remember that the string 'GOOSE' is not the same as the string 'goose'.*
