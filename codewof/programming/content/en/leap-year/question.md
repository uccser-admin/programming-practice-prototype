# Leap Year

Write a function `is_leap_year(year)` that takes a year and **returns** `True` if `year` is a leap year or `False` if it is not. The following rules determine whether a year is a leap year:

- A leap year must be evenly divisible by 4.
- A year that is evenly divisible by 100 is *only* a leap year if it is also evenly divisible by 400.

*Hint: the modulo operator  `%`  is useful for finding out if a number is divisible by another number.*
