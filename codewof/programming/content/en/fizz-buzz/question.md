# Fizz Buzz

Write a function `fizz_buzz(num)` that takes a number, `num`, as an argument.

- If the number is divisible by 3, it should **print** `Fizz`.
- If it is divisible by 5, it should **print** `Buzz`.
- If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should **print** `FizzBuzz`.
- Otherwise, it should **print** the same number, `num`.

 *Hint: the modulo operator  `%`  is useful for finding out if a number is divisible by another number.*
