# nth to last

The following function `nth_to_last(items, n)` takes a list (`items`) and a number (`n`), and should **return** the item nth from last in the list.
In other words; n = 1 should **return** the last item, n = 2 should **return** the second to last, and so on.

n will always be an integer between 1 and the length of the list (inclusive).

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
