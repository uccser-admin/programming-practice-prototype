# Add Up Numbers

The following function `add_up(numbers)` takes a list of numbers and adds them up.

The function is supposed to **print** out the sum of all the numbers, but there's a problem: it is printing out all the intermediate sums along the way too.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
