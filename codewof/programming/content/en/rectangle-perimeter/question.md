# Rectangle Perimeter

The following function `rectangle_perimeter(length, width)` should take the length and width of a rectangle and **return** the length of the perimeter of the rectangle. 
The formula for the length of the perimeter of a rectangle is `perimeter_length = 2(length + width)`.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
