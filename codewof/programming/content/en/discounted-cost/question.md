# Discounted Cost

The following function `discounted_cost(price, discount_percent)` takes two arguments:

- `price`: The original price of the item
- `discount_percent`: The discount that should be applied to the item, e.g. `20` for a 20% discount.

It should return the discounted cost of the item, but something is wrong.
Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
