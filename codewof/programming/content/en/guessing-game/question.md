# Guessing Game

Write a program that plays one round of a number guessing game by asking the user for their guess (using the `input` function), and then **printing** a response. 
The number your program is thinking of is `25`. 
If the user guesses a number below `25` then **print** `Too low!`. 
If the user guesses a number above `25` then **print** `Too high!`. 
If the user guesses the number `25` then **print** `Just right! How did you know?`
