# Rectangle Pattern

Write a function `rectangle(width, height)` that takes two integers `width` and `height` and **prints** out a rectangle (made up of `#` symbols) of the given width and height.

If `width` or `height` is less than 0 (inclusive), your function should **print** `That isn't a rectangle!`
