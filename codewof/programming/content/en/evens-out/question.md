# Evens Out

The following function `evens_out(numbers)` is supposed to take a list of numbers and **return** a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list.

But there's a problem: it is leaving out all the *odd* numbers, instead of all the evens.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
