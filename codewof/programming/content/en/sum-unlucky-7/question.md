# Sum unlucky seven

The following function `sum_unlucky_7(numbers)` takes a list of integers as an argument, and should **print** the sum of elements in the list.
However, the number 7 is an unlucky number.
All 7s should be ignored, and any non-7 numbers immediately after a 7 should also be ignored.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
