# Sum lucky 7

Create a function `sum_lucky_7(numbers)` that takes a list of numbers and **prints** the sum of these numbers.

However, the number 7 is a lucky number!
All 7's should be doubled before being added to the sum.

*Note: Your function should return 0 for an empty list.*

For example `sum_lucky_7([6, 13, 1, 7, 4, 2])` should **print** `40`, and `sum_lucky_7([7, 7, 7])` should **print** `42`.
