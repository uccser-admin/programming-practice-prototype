# Marco Polo

Write a program that **prints** `Marco?` and asks the user repeatedly for input until they write `Polo`.

If the user enters `Polo` then **print** `Hello there!`, otherwise **print** `Marco?`

*Hint: you can compare two strings in the same way you compare two numbers.*

*Hint: a `while` loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run.*
