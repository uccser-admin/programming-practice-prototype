# Even or Odd?

Write a function `even_or_odd(number)` that takes a number, `number`, and **prints** `Even` if the number is even, or `Odd` if the number is odd.

*Hint: the `%` (modulo) operator is useful when figuring out if a number is even or odd. 
Remember that even numbers are divisible by 2*
