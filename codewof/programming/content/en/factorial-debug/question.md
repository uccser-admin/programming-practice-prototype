# Factorial (debug)

The following function `factorial(x)` takes an integer `x`, and should **return** `x!`.
For example: `factorial(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6`

If `x` is less than 1 or greater than 10 the function should **return** `None`.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
