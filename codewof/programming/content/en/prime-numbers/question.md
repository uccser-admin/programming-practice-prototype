# Prime Numbers

Write a program that asks for a positive integer as input and **prints** all the prime numbers between 0 and that number (inclusive).
If there are no primes your program should print `No primes.`.

For example if the input is `23` your program should output:

```
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19
23
```
