# Playing card

Write a program that prompts the user for a card.
If the user enters a type of playing card, your program should **print** `That's a playing card!`.

Your program should keep prompting for a card until the user enters something that is not a type of playing card.
Then your program should **print** `That's not a playing card!` and quit.

For this question, a type of playing card is any integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), or a string `A`, `J`, `Q` or `K`.

*Hint: It might be useful to use `while {variable} in {list}:` for your comparison.*
