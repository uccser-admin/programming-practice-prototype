# Driver speed

Write a function `check_speed(speed)` that checks if a driver is driving above the speed limit.

- If the speed is less than or equal to 50, the function should **print** `Ok.`
- If the speed is above 50, the function should **print** `Too fast!`
- If the speed is 75 or higher then the function should *also* **print** `Licence suspended.`

For example: `check_speed(53)` should **print** `Too fast!`, and `check_speed(75)` should **print**:
```
Too fast!
Licence suspended.
```
