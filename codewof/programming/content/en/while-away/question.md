# While Away

The following function `while_away(minutes)` is supposed to take a number of minutes and **print** the message `I'm away` for each minute, and then **print** `I'm back`.

But there's a problem: it gets stuck in an infinite loop, printing `I'm away` forever!

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.

*Note: For clarity, your function does* **not** *need to wait for a minute between printing each message.
The loop just needs to repeat for the same number of times as the number of minutes.*
