# Give Me Five

Write a program that asks the user repeatedly for input until it gets `5`.

If the user enters a `5`, then **print** `High five!`, otherwise **print** `Give me five`.
Keep asking the user for input until they enter `5`. 

*Hint: a* `while` *loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run*
