# Inside or outside

The following function `inside_or_outside(number, lower, upper)` takes three numbers as arguments.

- It should **print** `Inside` if `number` is in the range between `lower` and `upper` (inclusive).
- It should **print** `Outside` if `number` is less than `lower` or greater than `upper`.

You can assume that `lower` will always be smaller than or equal to `upper`.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
