# Rollercoaster ride

Write a function `ride_the_rollercoaster(age, with_an_adult)` that takes a number and a boolean value (i.e. `True` or ` False`) and **prints** a message saying whether you can ride the rollercoaster.

To ride the rollercoaster a person needs to be 10 or older, or if they are younger they need to be accompanied by an adult.

If the person can ride the rollercoaster then the function should **print** `You can ride the rollercoaster`.
If they cannot ride the rollercoaster then the function should **print** `Sorry, you cannot ride the rollercoaster`.

For example, an 8 year old can't ride the rollercoaster if there isn't an adult with them, so `ride_the_rollercoaster(8, False)` should **print** `Sorry, you cannot ride the rollercoaster`.
