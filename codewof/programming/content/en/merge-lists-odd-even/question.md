# Merge lists

Write a function `merge_lists(list_1, list_2)` that takes two lists containing integers and **returns** a third list that contains only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

For example `merge_lists([11, 26, 17, 99, 42], [12, 43, 98, 36, 9, 13])` should **return** `[11, 17, 99, 12, 98, 36]`.
