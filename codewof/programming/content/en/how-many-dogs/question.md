# How many dogs?

The following function `number_of_dogs(pets)` takes a list of strings `pets`, and **returns** the number of times the string `dog` appears in the list.
It is not case sensitive, `Dog`, `DOG` and others should also be accepted.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
