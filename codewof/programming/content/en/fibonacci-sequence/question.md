# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc...).
Write a function `fibonacci(limit)` that **prints** all the Fibonacci numbers that are less than `limit`.

*Hint: a `while` loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run.*
