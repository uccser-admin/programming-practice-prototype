<p>
    This style checker will check your code against the main conventions recommended for Python in <a
        href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> (Style Guide for Python Code) and <a
        href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">PEP 257</a> (Docstring Conventions).
    Fine tuning your code to pass these common conventions makes it easy for others to read your Python code.
